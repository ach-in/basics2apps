<h3><p align="center">Convolutional Neural Network</p></h3><br>

The talk will focus on a special class of deep neural networks, called the Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN). CNNs have revolutionlized machine learning for tasks in computer vision and natural language processing. CNNs are a variation of multilayer perceptrons as they process their inputs much more efficiently with convolutional filters. We will talk about different strategies for convolutions including transposed convolution, dilated convolution, fully connected layer as a convolution etc.
