<h3><p align="center">Intro to Deep Learning</p></h3>
This talk will introduce the concept of a neural network and explore its intrinsics, specifically how data is feed into a neural network and discuss gradient descent and its various types which are used to train the parameters of a neural network. Next, the concept of learning rate will be discussed in terms of how an effective learning rate is required to train a neural network.
