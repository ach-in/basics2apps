Deep Learning in 3D:

Even though most visual deep learning processes 2D images, the real world has three spatial dimensions, and neural architectures can analyze and model 3D objects directly. However, obvious extensions of image-based networks to voxel grids are frequently not the best choice, since 3D shapes have a variety of popular alternative representations such as polygon meshes, point clouds or part assemblies. These representations have unique strengths, but standard convolutional architectures cannot directly process them. I will explore a variety of ways in which deep learning can be applied to 3D vision and geometry processing, introducing the mathematical tools required to extend neural networks to manifolds, hierarchies and graphs.
