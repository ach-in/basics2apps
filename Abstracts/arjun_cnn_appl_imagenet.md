<h3><p align="center">CNN Applications and Case studies for ImageNet</p><h3><br>

The talk will focus on image classification problem and how convolutional neural networks(CNNs) outperformed the state-of-the-art on the Imagenet challenge. We will start with the ground-breaking Alexnet model and see the evolution of deep models into more sophisticated architectures like Resnet, GoogleNet, VGGNet etc.
